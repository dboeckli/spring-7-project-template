= Spring Boot 7 Template Project

== Introduction
This project serves as a template for Spring Boot 4 applications. It provides a solid foundation for quickly starting new Spring Boot projects with pre-configured settings and best practices.

== Prerequisites
* GitHub account
* Git
* JDK 25 or later
* Maven
* IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any preferred IDE
* Docker account (for image publishing)

== Getting Started

=== 1. Project Setup
. In GitHub, create a new project using this template.
. In the new project's Settings:
** Enable 'Automatically delete head branches'
** Enable 'Always suggest updating pull request branches'
. Set Branch Protection Rules similar to this template project. Do not Lock Master branch there.

=== 2. Local Development Setup
. Clone the newly created project.
. Configure Maven settings in your IDE:
** Point to a valid `settings.xml` for GitHub dependency resolution.
** Set local Maven repository outside of Microsoft's cloud (e.g., `C:\development\tools\maven-repo`).
. Create a feature branch for your changes.

=== 3. Project Customization
. Search for TODOs in the project and update the following:
** Rename `group-id` and `artifact-id` in `pom.xml`
** Update `name` in `application.yaml`
** Ensure all names match your GitHub project name
. Rename packages and classes as needed.

=== 4. GitHub Configuration
. Add the following secrets in your GitHub project Action settings:
** `DOCKER_USER`
** `DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
** `SONAR_TOKEN`: a Sonar Token generated in https://sonarcloud.io. Sonar Analysis Method: Automatic Analysis disabled.
** `RELEASE_TOKEN`: A GitHub Personal Access Token with permissions to push to the master branch
** To create this token:
... Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
... Click "Generate new token" (classic)
... Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Release Token for [Your Project Name]")
... Set the expiration as needed
... Select at least these scopes: `repo`, `write:packages`
... Generate the token and copy it immediately
** Add this token as a secret named `RELEASE_TOKEN` in your repository settings
. Add the following vars in your GitHub project Action settings:
** CI_USER and set value to dboeckli@gmail.com
** CI_USER_EMAIL set value to dboeckli@gmail.com
. Add the following secrets in your GitHub project Dependent Bot settings:
** `DOCKER_USER`
** `DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN`

=== 5. Build and Deployment
. Trigger a rebuild in GitHub Actions.
. Upon successful build:
** A Docker image will be pushed to GitHub Packages and Docker Hub.
** Access your Docker Hub repository: https://hub.docker.com/repositories/domboeckli
** Change the Docker Hub image visibility from private to public to unlock it.

=== 6. Release
To create a new release:

. Ensure you are on the main branch and it is up to date:
. Run the release workflow:
** Go to your GitHub repository
** Navigate to the "Actions" tab
** Select the "Maven Release" workflow
** Click "Run workflow"
** Choose the main branch and click "Run workflow"
. The workflow will:
** Check if you're on the main branch
** Verify that the current version is a SNAPSHOT
** Prepare the release (update versions, create tag)
** Perform the release (build, test, and deploy)
** Push changes back to the repository
. After the workflow completes successfully:
** A new release tag will be created in your repository
** The project version in pom.xml will be updated
** A new Docker image with the release version will be pushed to Docker Hub
. Verify the release:
** Check the releases page on GitHub
** Confirm the new version in pom.xml on the main branch
** Verify the new Docker image on Docker Hub

NOTE: Ensure all required secrets (RELEASE_TOKEN, DOCKER_USER, DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN) are properly set in your GitHub repository settings before running the release workflow.

== Deployment with Kubernetes

To run maven filtering for destination target/k8s

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

Deployment goes into the default namespace.

To deploy all resources:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f target/k8s/
----

To remove all resources:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete -f target/k8s/
----

Check

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get deployments -o wide
kubectl get pods -o wide
----

You can use the actuator rest call to verify via port 30080

== Deployment with Helm

Be aware that we are using a different namespace here (not default).

To run maven filtering for destination target/helm

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

Go to the directory where the tgz file has been created after 'mvn install'

[source,powershell]
----
cd target/helm/repo
----

unpack

[source,powershell]
----
$file = Get-ChildItem -Filter *.tgz | Select-Object -First 1
tar -xvf $file.Name
----

install

[source,powershell]
----
$APPLICATION_NAME = Get-ChildItem -Directory | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -ge $file.LastWriteTime } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
helm upgrade --install $APPLICATION_NAME ./$APPLICATION_NAME --namespace spring-7-project-template --create-namespace --wait --timeout 8m --debug --render-subchart-notes
----

show logs

[source,powershell]
----
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=$APPLICATION_NAME -n spring-7-project-template
----

replace $POD with pods from the command above

[source,powershell]
----
kubectl logs $POD -n spring-7-project-template --all-containers
----

test

[source,powershell]
----
helm test $APPLICATION_NAME --namespace spring-7-project-template --logs
----

uninstall

[source,powershell]
----
helm uninstall $APPLICATION_NAME --namespace spring-7-project-template
----

delete all

[source,powershell]
----
kubectl delete all --all -n spring-7-project-template
----

create busybox sidecar

[source,powershell]
----
kubectl run busybox-test --rm -it --image=busybox:1.36 --namespace=spring-7-project-template --command -- sh
----

You can use the actuator rest call to verify via port 30080
